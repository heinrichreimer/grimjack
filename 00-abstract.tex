\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we present the Team's Grimjack retrieval approaches for the Touch√© shared task on Argument Retrieval for Comparative Questions. In total, we submit five runs that pursue the two main objectives: favoring argumentative and high argument quality documents in the final ranking and balancing stance-based exposure by ensuring an even ratio of pro and con arguments at top ranks.
Our results indicate that BM25 outperforms query likelihood ranking for initial passage retrieval and that stance-based re-ranking can slightly improve a ranking's effectiveness.
Stance classification by prompting the T0 zero-shot language model is the best-performing approach in the shared task's leaderboard.
