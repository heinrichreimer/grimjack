\subsection{Manual Assessment of Top-5 Results}
% \input{table-judgments}
\input{table-effectiveness}

We assess the effectiveness of our approach by looking at the top-10 retrieved passages in the \emph{Fair Re-ranking and Argumentative Axioms}~(Fair) and \emph{All You Need is T0}~(T0) runs for the three topics~36~(\textquote{What IDE is better for Java: NetBeans or Eclipse?}), 48~(\textquote{Is pasta healthier than pizza?}), and~69~(\textquote{Who was a better boxer, Muhammad Ali or Joe Frazier?}).
We manually judge relevance and stance for the 35~documents pooled from our \emph{Fair Re-ranking and Argumentative Axioms} and \emph{All You Need is T0} runs up to depth~10 for the three topics before the official results are made available by the organizers.
Table~\ref{table-effectiveness} shows the normalized discounted cumulative gain, precision, and mean average precision for the top-10 documents from based on our manual judgments.
Our results indicate that the T0-based approach is slightly better at comparing opinionated queries like topic~69 while the axiomatic and fairness re-ranking approach might improve the effectiveness for more fact-based queries.
We look forward to further investigate this finding when deeper relevance judgments are made available by the organizers.

\subsection{Transferring Relevance Judgements from Touché~2020--2021}
\label{transfer-relevance-judgements}

For a systematic evaluation of all runs with different metrics for effectiveness following the Cranfield paradigm, we also experiment with transferring the relevance judgements from previous editions of the Touché shared task~\cite{BondarenkoFBGAPBSWPH2020,BondarenkoGFBAPBSWPH2021}.
In~2020 and~2021, however, the results were judged on the document level.
Therefore, we using the topics and relevance judgements from Touché~2020--2021, but retrieve passages from the extracted passages in this year's collection~\cite{BondarenkoFKSGBPBSWPH2022}.
Then we assume that if a document was relevant all passages extracted from that document are relevant as well, that is, the passages inherit their containing document's relevance label.
Unfortunately, we could only match 16.76\,\% of the passages retrieved by our baseline with document relevance labels from Touché~2020--2021.
Because of the insufficient label coverage we do not include a more detailed evaluation of effectiveness using previous editions' judgements.
