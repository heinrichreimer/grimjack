\section{Evaluation}
    The approach has been successfully deployed on the evaluation platform Tira\footnote{https://www.tira.io/}. Our approach can we found under the name XXXX. Tira automatically evaluates the submitted approaches of the participants of the shared task and reports the NDCG@5. The organizers use this site to ensure a reproducible leaderboard. We will now have a closer look at the performance of our approach by looking at the first 5 results of three chosen topics for two different runs. The two runs we are looking at are (1) without query reformulation/expansion and axiomatic reranking and (2) with query reformulation/expansion and axiomatic reranking.
