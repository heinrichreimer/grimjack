\begin{abstract}
    In this paper we propose an approach to answer comparative questions and detect the stance of the resulting passages towards the comparasion object. The approach consists of four components: (a) Query Reformulation and Query Combiner, (b) Retrieval of passages (c) Argument quality and stance tagging and (d) Axiomatic reranking. We show how the language model T5 can be used to accomplish query reformulation and tagging of arguemnt quality and stance. Furthermore, we propose different reranking strategies originating from different user models.
