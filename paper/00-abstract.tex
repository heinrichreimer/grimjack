\begin{abstract}
    In this paper, we (Team Grimjack) propose an approach to answer comparative questions and detect the stance of the resulting passages towards the comparison object. The approach consists of four components: (a) Query Reformulation and Query Combiner, (b) Retrieval of passages (c) Argument quality and stance tagging, and (d) Axiomatic reranking. We show how the language model T0 can be used to accomplish query reformulation and tagging of argument quality and stance. Furthermore, we propose different reranking strategies originating from different user models.
